The package LD3Ditp contains a Matlab-implementation for 3D polynomial interpolation on 
the node points LD of degenerate 3D-Lissajous curves. 

The main test file for interpolation is
main_example.m

For plotting 3D degenerate Lissajous curves and the LD points use
plot_Lissajous3D.m

The file plotregion.m was written by Per Bergstr√∂m 2006-01-16. In this package it is used as 
an auxiliary program in plot_Lissajous3D.m to plot the polygonal boundary of the index sets.
